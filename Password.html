              <p>
                A password by definition is a secret phrase or string of characters which is used to identify the user during the authentication process.
              <p>
              <h1>Strong password Advice</h1>
              <p>
                To create a strong password it shouldn't be something that can't be guessed to easily such as your birthday,your name or country.
                <li>The longer the password obviously the more secure it is but 12 charcaters minimum is recommended</li>
                <li>Use different numbers,letters and symbols throughout your Password</li>
                <li>Don't do obvious letter or word combination like 123456,abc,asdfghjkl; as they are too easy to guess</li>
                <h1>Creating Passwords</h1>
                A problem people have with remembering hard passwords is they well they can't remember it, Its easy to get a complex password like U$f!Sc^b!xD$Ac which as 14 Characters and vaious of simples and letters but noone can remember that
                <p><b>Think of a word then number combination</b></p>
                  Think of a common word you would remember like School then a number phrase you would remember like 02468 then add one letter then one number at a time "S0c2h5o6o8l"
                  <p><b>Think of a sentence</b></p>
                  Think of a phrase you would rememnber like "The brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" then remove the vowels and spaces so it would be like "ThBrwnFxJumpdvrThLzyDg"
                  If you can't think of a sentence then use your favourite song title
                  <p><b>Using 2StepVerification</b></p>
                  2 Step Verification is like adding another layer of protection to your account.
                  If your account offers 2 step verification then its recommended that you turn it on.
                  For something like your Google account. Their 2 step verificaiton works in using your normal password then once entered sends a code to your device
